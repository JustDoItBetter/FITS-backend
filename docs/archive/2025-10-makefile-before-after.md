[BUILD] Compiling binary...
[SUCCESS] Binary created: bin/fits-server
[TEST] Running unit tests...
[ERROR] Failed to connect to database
```

## 📝 Script Quality

### Database Reset

**BEFORE (`reset_db_only.sh`):**
```bash
# Basic truncation
PGPASSWORD="$DB_PASSWORD" psql ... << 'EOF'
TRUNCATE TABLE signatures CASCADE;
TRUNCATE TABLE reports CASCADE;
...
EOF
```

**AFTER (`db_reset.sh`):**
```bash
# Professional with optimizations
PGPASSWORD="$DB_PASSWORD" psql ... <<'SQL'
-- Disable triggers for speed
SET session_replication_role = replica;

-- Truncate all tables
TRUNCATE TABLE signatures CASCADE;
...

-- Re-enable triggers
SET session_replication_role = DEFAULT;

-- Verify tables are empty (with row counts)
DO $$
DECLARE
    table_record RECORD;
    row_count INTEGER;
BEGIN
    FOR table_record IN ... LOOP
        EXECUTE 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ' || table_record.table_name INTO row_count;
        RAISE NOTICE '  ✓ % (% rows)', table_record.table_name, row_count;
    END LOOP;
END $$;
SQL
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Faster execution (triggers disabled)
- ✅ Verification of results
- ✅ Color-coded output
- ✅ Better error messages
- ✅ Next-steps guidance

## 🗄️ Database Management

### BEFORE
```bash
make reset-db       # Truncate tables
# No way to verify schema
# No way to seed data
# No status check
# No logs viewing
```

### AFTER
```bash
make db-status      # Check PostgreSQL health
make db-up          # Start with health wait
make db-down        # Graceful shutdown
make db-logs        # View live logs
make db-reset       # Smart truncation
make db-seed        # Automated test data (NEW!)
make db-destroy     # Complete wipe
make db-migrate     # Run migrations
make db-verify      # Schema integrity check
```

**New Capabilities:**
- ✅ Health checking with connection verification
- ✅ Automated test data population (9 accounts)
- ✅ Schema verification
- ✅ Live log viewing
- ✅ Smart wait loops for readiness

## 🔨 Build System

### BEFORE
```bash
make build          # Basic build
make clean          # Remove bin/
```

### AFTER
```bash
make build          # Development build (debug symbols)
make build-prod     # Production build (optimized, stripped, static)
make clean          # Remove bin/ + caches + test artifacts
```

**Production Build Features:**
```bash
# OLD
go build -o bin/fits-server cmd/server/main.go
# Result: 42MB with debug symbols

# NEW
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -trimpath -ldflags="-w -s" ...
# Result: 35MB, optimized, static
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ `-trimpath` for reproducible builds
- ✅ `-w -s` removes symbols (smaller binary)
- ✅ `CGO_ENABLED=0` for static linking
- ✅ Automatic size reporting

make e2e-test          # E2E only
make bench             # Benchmarks
```

### AFTER
```bash
make test              # Quick unit tests
make test-verbose      # Detailed output
make test-coverage     # HTML + terminal coverage (enhanced)
make test-watch        # Auto-run on file changes (NEW!)
make test-integration  # E2E tests (renamed for clarity)

make lint      # golangci-lint (improved)
make check     # All of the above + tests (NEW!)
make security  # Security scan with gosec (NEW!)
```

**Quality Pipeline:**
```bash
# OLD: Manual checks
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
golangci-lint run

# NEW: One command
make check
# Runs: fmt → vet → lint → test
# Result: "✓ All checks passed" or specific errors
```
